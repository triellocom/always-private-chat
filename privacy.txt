# Always Private Chat — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** September 1, 2025

## Summary

Always Private Chat does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension runs entirely on your device and only clicks each site’s built-in **Private/Temporary chat** toggle when you visit ChatGPT or Grok.

## What the extension does

* Injects a small content script on `chatgpt.com` and `grok.com`/`x.ai`.
* Locates the site’s **Private/Temporary** toggle and turns it **on** if it’s off.
* No other actions or features.

## Data collection

* **Collected:** None
* **Stored:** None
* **Sent to servers:** None
* **Cookies/Local storage:** Not used by the extension
* **Analytics/Tracking:** None

## Permissions

* **Host permissions** for `chatgpt.com` and `grok.com`/`x.ai` are required only so the script can read the page structure and click the toggle. The extension does not access or exfiltrate page content.

## Third parties

* No third-party code, SDKs, analytics, or advertising.

## Children’s privacy

* No data is collected from any users, including children.

## Changes to this policy

* If this policy changes, the update will be reflected here and in the extension changelog.

## Contact

* For questions or issues, please contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing page.
